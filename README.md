# Xylophone ðŸŽ¹

## Goal

In this app I dived into more Dart programming concepts and learning how to use open source Flutter packages. Now I am comfortable using Flutter packages and building repeated widgets.


## What is created

It is a music app that plays Xylophone sounds. For every Beethoven out there, this will let you unleash your musical talent where ever you are. 


## What is learnt

- How to incorporate open source libraries of code into your project using Flutter Packages.
- How to play sound on both iOS and Android.
- How to generate repeated user interface Widgets.
- How to use Dart functions that can take input arguments as well as return an output.
- Dart arrow syntax for writing one line functions.
